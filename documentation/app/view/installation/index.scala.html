@h( level ){ Installation }
@p {
	When your @cite{ Play Framework } (Scala) is @a( "http://www.playframework.com/documentation/2.1.1/Installing",
	a.target.blank ){ up } and @a( "http://www.playframework.com/documentation/2.1.1/NewApplication", a.target.blank ){
	running } you need to add @cite( name ) to your project dependencies. A binary version for easy integration is
	currently not available but will be published very soon. By then you have to compile the @a( repository, a.target.blank ){
	sources } by yourself, add a @code{ Build.scala } file and include it as a local repository. Or add it as sub
	project. Or just wait a few more days for me to publish the binaries and provide a better installation guide.
}
@p {
	If you're planning to use @cite{ @name's } @a( "http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap/index.html", a.target.blank ){
	@cite{ Twitter Bootstrap } } utilities you have to take care of adding all necessary files to your application and
	to reference them in your view's @code{ &lt;head /&gt; } area.
}

@h3 { Integration }
@p {
	The dependencies are set up properly and you want to start building some beautiful views? Well, then it's time to
	deal with the imports now. Add @code( "com.taig.tmpltr.engine.html._" ) to the import directives in the head of
	your view and @strong{ all } the @cite{ HTML } tools will be ready to use. But without importing @code( "com.taig.tmpltr._" )
	using them won't be fun, because all the implicit conversions are located there. So make sure to add both statements
	before you go on.
}

@p {
	If your view now looks somehow like this, your basic configuration is ready.
}
@Example1

@p {
	You may have already noticed the @code{ engine } part in the previous import statements. You won't be surprised if
	I tell you that there are even more packages in there, will you? To enable the module's @cite{ Twitter Bootstrap }
	support you simply have to import @code( "com.taig.tmpltr.engine.bootstrap._" ). Unfortunately this will cause
	namespace issues if you're planning to use the @cite{ HTML } and the @cite{ Twitter Bootstrap } engine simultaneously.
	Therefore you need to overcome this by prefixing the @code{ bootstrap } utilities (use
	@code( "com.taig.tmpltr.engine.bootstrap" ) or @code( "com.taig.tmpltr.engine.{ bootstrap => bs }" ) instead).
}
@Example2

@p {
	Alternatively you can add frequently used imports to your @code{ Build.scala } file. That's a useful thing if
	you have multiple views that rely on @cite( name ). Open your @code{ project/Build.scala } file and add the import
	directives to your project settings. @cite{ Play } will then take care of importing these files into your views.
	Less pain for you.
