@p {
	When your @cite{ Play Framework } (Scala) application is
	@a( s"http://www.playframework.com/documentation/${Version.play}/Installing", a.target.blank ){ up } and
	@a( s"http://www.playframework.com/documentation/${Version.play}/NewApplication", a.target.blank ){ running } you need to add
	@cite( name ) to your project dependencies. In order to do so you have to add my @cite{ GitHub } page as resolver.
}

@example.simple{ resolvers += Resolver.url( "Play Tmpltr", url( "http://taig.github.io/Play-Tmpltr/release" ) )( Resolver.ivyStylePatterns ) }

@p {
	Now @cite{ sbt } will automatically fetch the @cite( name ) binaries for you if you add it to the project
	dependencies.
}
@example.simple{ libraryDependencies += "com.taig" %% "play-tmpltr" % "@Version.tmpltr" }

@h3 { Integration }
@p {
	The dependencies are set up properly and you want to start building some beautiful views? Well, then it's time to
	deal with the imports now. Add @code( "com.taig.tmpltr.engine.html._" ) to the import directives in the head of
	your view and @strong{ all } the @cite{ HTML } tools will be ready to use. But without importing @code( "com.taig.tmpltr._" )
	using them won't be fun, because all the implicit conversions are located there. So make sure to add both statements
	before you go on.
}

@p {
	If your view now looks somehow like this, your basic configuration is ready.
}
@example.simple(
	Txt( """
		|@*************************
		|* Your view's signature. *
		|*************************@
		|@( args: Any* )
		|
		|@***********************
		|* Play Tmpltr imports. *
		|***********************@
		|@import com.taig.tmpltr._
		|@import com.taig.tmpltr.engine.html._
		|
		|@p{ Your @cite{ HTML5 } goes here. }
		""".stripMargin
	)
)

@p {
	Alternatively you can add frequently used imports to your @code{ Build.scala } file. That's a useful thing if
	you have multiple views that rely on @cite( name ). Open your @code{ project/Build.scala } file and add the import
	directives to your project settings. @cite{ Play } will then take care of importing these files into your views.
	Less pain for you.
}
@example.simple(
	Txt( """
		|val main = play.Project( "project-name", "1.0" ).settings(
		|    templatesImport ++= Seq(
		|        "com.taig.tmpltr._",
		|        "com.taig.tmpltr.engine.html._"
		|    )
		|)
		""".stripMargin
	)
)

	@h4{ Please Note }
	@p {
		Predefining the imports in your @code{ Build.scala } file may break your IDE's code completion. Start off by
		manually importing the @cite( name ) tools if you feel like you're missing some hints from your IDE to find
		your way around.
