@p {
	I love the @cite{ Play Framework }. And I also love how beatuiful its views can be with plain old @cite{ HTML }
	and some @cite{ Scala } variables here and there. But no later than when it comes to build up some @cite{ Twitter
	Bootstrap } forms the drawbacks are inevitable. The views suddenly become a varied mixture of @cite{ HTML } and
	some way too inflexible field constructorsâ€”or they drown in repetetive boilerplate code that is required by
	@cite{ Bootstrap }. @cite( name ) is an approach to create consistent and beautiful views within the @cite{
	Play Framework }.
