@p{
	I will list the module's most important features with useful examples below. If you are missing something take a
	look into the @a( sample, a.target.blank ){ source code } of this documentation page. It's actually a @cite{ Play }
	application built with @cite( name ). Alternatively you might want to browse the @a( documentation, a.target.blank ){
	@cite{ ScalaDoc } } to get an overview of the available features. Also this module is far from being feature
	complete. So if you find yourself adding some utilities for your project please send me a pull request!
