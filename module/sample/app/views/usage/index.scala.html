	I will list the module's most important features with useful examples below. If you are missing something take a
	look into the @html.a( sample, Target.Blank ){ source code } of this documentation page. It's actually a
	@html.cite{ Play } application built with @html.cite( name ). Alternatively you might want to browse the
	@html.a( documentation, Target.Blank ){ @html.cite{ ScalaDoc } } to get an overview of the available features.
	Also this module is far from being feature complete. So if you find yourself adding some utilities for your project
	please send me a pull request!
